TODO

 - see if we can replace the standard qml input component with meego input to avoid the keyboard bug
 - the stations list page should show more data for each station
 - the trains list page should show more data for each train
 - the train page should show more information for each item
 - in the train page, if you click a station you should go to the station view
 - the station page needs some UI cleanup
 - in the station page, when a train is touched, it should go to the train page?
 - the trains information page
 - add the proximity check
 - when user enter the train/station page from history or nearby page, should the back button take them back to history/nearby?
 - add a twitter page? is it really useful?

 - the search box could by displayed dynamically (on pull down, like the harmattan mail app?)
 - the view animation is slowed down or even almost killed when a lot of work is being done in onViewShown/onViewHidden.
